SOS
======
**SOS (Save Our Summer)** is a bucket list tool designed for families.  While living in rural Utah, my family and I were half-way through summer vacation when we realized that we had been squandering our few months of toasty weather.  We knew that we had to take action immediately or else the icy feelings of regret would be the only thing colder than the Utah winter.  It was time for this family to make the most of our summer.  Enter Operation SOS.  The idea is simple: create a trackable bucket list with all of our summer desires. 

SOS is intended to be a full bucket list solution, including: 
* Serverless REST API built on AWS Lambda
* API Gateway
* DynamoDB
* S3 bucket (used for photo storage)
* Android mobile application
